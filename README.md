# Yargs-Notesapp
Creating a command line notes app with yargs as a parser, and a json file as database.

Modules
- Chalk : Prettier,  but on terminal.
- Yargs : Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools, by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface.
- File system module (fs)

What i learned
   In this project, i was able to learn proper usage of the file system and how it connects with other modules (yargs, chalk) and their manipulation. Also, it brings to question the use of proper folder structure and syntax related to NodeJs (import as in the require usage, and export for locally made folders).

Continued Development
   This project can further be expanded using yargs, to query database, or pass and parse in values that require extra input as related to terminal.

For more usage of the modules, do reference their documentations on npmjs.com
